## ✨ Overview

**Millie** is an **AI Co-Pilot for Dutch Bros Broistas**, automating order entry while preserving genuine customer interaction.  
It listens to live customer–broista conversations, transcribes speech to text, identifies drink orders and modifiers, predicts rush patterns, and updates the POS automatically — *“Automation does the typing; broistas keep the magic.”*

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

- ⏱️ **Typing steals time:** Manual entry of complex drinks and modifiers is slow and error-prone.  
- 🕐 **Late customer context:** DutchPass QR is scanned only at checkout, losing personalization opportunities.  
- 💬 **No “usual” prompt:** No automatic personalization during rush hours.  
- ⚡ **KDS not proactive:** No shared ETAs or rush alerts between broistas.  
- 🧩 **Training overhead:** New broistas struggle to learn the manual POS flow.

## 📈 Business Impact

| Metric | Impact |
|---------|---------|
| ⏳ **Speed** | Typing removed → Line times drop, especially during peak hours (7–10 AM, 11–2 PM, 7–10 PM). |
| ✅ **Accuracy** | Drink modifiers and add-ons captured correctly; remakes reduced. |
| 💬 **Connection** | Broistas stay “eyes-up”; “The Usual” becomes one-tap authentic. |
| 🧘 **Operational Calm** | Rush Radar + shared ETAs stabilize operations. |
| 🔐 **Security** | End-to-end encryption with mTLS and SigV4; no exposed AWS keys. |
